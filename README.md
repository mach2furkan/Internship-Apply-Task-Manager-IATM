## üéØ Example Workflow

1. **Add Tasks**:
   - Add multiple tasks with their details (e.g., title, description, priority, category, deadline).
   - Example:
     ```
     Title: Complete Internship Application
     Description: Submit application for XYZ company
     Priority: High
     Category: Career
     Deadline: 2023-12-01
     ```

2. **View All Tasks**:
   - Display a list of all tasks currently in the system.

3. **Search by Title**:
   - Search for "Application" to find all tasks with "Application" in their title.

4. **Filter by Category**:
   - Filter tasks under the "Career" category.

5. **Edit Task Details**:
   - Update a task's priority or deadline.

6. **Delete a Task**:
   - Remove a task from the system if it is no longer relevant.

7. **Sort by Priority**:
   - Sort tasks in descending order of priority.

8. **Save to File**:
   - Save all task data to `tasks.txt` for persistence.

9. **Load from File**:
   - Load previously saved data from `tasks.txt`.

10. **View Statistics Dashboard**:
    - Get insights into your task management:
      ```
      Total Tasks: 5
      Completed Tasks: 2
      Incomplete Tasks: 3
      Most Common Category: Career
      ```

11. **Export Data to CSV**:
    - Export task data to a CSV file for further analysis.

12. **Track Progress**:
    - Mark a task as "In Progress" or "Completed."

13. **Receive Deadline Alerts**:
    - Get notified about tasks with upcoming deadlines.

14. **Switch Users**:
    - Log in as a different user to manage their tasks.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Modern C++ (C++17/C++20)
- **Data Structures**: Vectors, Maps, Structs
- **File Handling**: Input/Output Streams (`ifstream`, `ofstream`)
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Standard Library Sorting (`std::sort`)
- **String Manipulation**: Partial matching with `std::string::find`
- **JSON Export**: Custom logic to write data into JSON format
- **CLI Enhancements**: ANSI escape codes for colors and animations

## üìù Code Structure

The project is organized into modular components for clarity and maintainability:

1. **`main.cpp`**: Entry point of the program. Handles user interaction and menu navigation.
2. **`TaskManager.h` / `TaskManager.cpp`**: Core functionality for managing tasks (add, edit, delete, sort, etc.).
3. **`FileHandler.h` / `FileHandler.cpp`**: Handles saving and loading data to/from files.
4. **`Utils.h` / `Utils.cpp`**: Utility functions for string manipulation, input validation, and animations.
5. **`UserManager.h` / `UserManager.cpp`**: Manages multi-user support (login, logout, user-specific data).

---

## üìä Why This Project Stands Out

### **Professional Design**
- Modular code structure ensures readability and maintainability.
- Object-oriented principles are applied effectively.

### **Interactive Features**
- The system provides a user-friendly interface with clear instructions and feedback.

### **Real-World Relevance**
- Simulates a practical use case for task management, making it highly relatable for companies and recruiters.

### **Persistence and Scalability**
- Data persistence via file handling ensures that task information is not lost between sessions.
- Multi-user support allows scalability for larger organizations.

### **Advanced Functionality**
- Task prioritization, deadline alerts, and progress tracking make this system stand out from basic CRUD applications.

## üß™ Future Enhancements

While this version is robust and feature-rich, here are some ideas for future improvements:
1. **Database Integration**: Replace file handling with a database (e.g., SQLite) for better scalability.
2. **Web Interface**: Develop a web-based frontend using frameworks like Flask or Django.
3. **Authentication**: Add secure login functionality with password hashing.
4. **Notifications**: Send email or desktop notifications for upcoming deadlines.
5. **Collaboration Features**: Allow multiple users to collaborate on shared tasks.
6. **Cross-Platform GUI**: Build a graphical user interface (GUI) using Qt or wxWidgets.
